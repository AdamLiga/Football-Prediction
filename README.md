This repository contains the code and resources for my Bachelor's Thesis, where I predicted the outcomes of football matches from the English Premier League, La Liga (Spain), and the Bundesliga (Germany) using various machine learning techniques. The primary goal of this project was to explore and implement different machine learning models to accurately forecast the results of upcoming football matches based on historical data.
